# Chat Server Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issues

- Chat server being killed by Railway due to resource constraints
- Client not connecting on Vercel deployment
- Missing connection logs in browser console

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Vercel deployment:

```
VITE_CHAT_SERVER_URL=https://efficient-wholeness-production.up.railway.app
```

### 2. Test Chat Server Directly

Visit these URLs in your browser to test the chat server:

- `https://efficient-wholeness-production.up.railway.app/test`
- `https://efficient-wholeness-production.up.railway.app/health`

### 3. Check Browser Console

Open browser dev tools and look for these logs:

- `ðŸ”Œ Connecting to Socket.IO chat server...`
- `ðŸ”Œ Chat server URL: [url]`
- `âœ… Socket.IO connected to chat server`
- `ðŸš¨ Socket.IO connection error: [error]`

### 4. Railway Resource Issues

The chat server is being killed due to memory constraints. Solutions:

- Upgrade Railway plan for more RAM
- Reduce memory usage in the application
- Use external database for message storage

### 5. CORS Issues

If you see CORS errors:

- Check that the chat server allows your Vercel domain
- Verify CORS configuration in chat-server/server.js

### 6. Network Issues

- Check if Railway service is accessible from Vercel
- Verify firewall/proxy settings
- Test with different browsers/devices

## Quick Fixes Applied

1. **Memory Optimization**: Reduced Socket.IO buffer size and ping frequency
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging
3. **Connection Retry**: Implemented automatic reconnection
4. **Health Monitoring**: Added memory usage tracking
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling for Railway

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated chat server to Railway
2. Set environment variables in Vercel
3. Test the connection using the browser console
4. Monitor Railway logs for memory usage
5. Consider upgrading Railway plan if issues persist
